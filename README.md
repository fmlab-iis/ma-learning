# Multiplicity Automata Learning Library (MALL)

We apply a probably approximately correct learning algorithm for multiplicity automata to generate quantitative models of system behaviors with a statistical guarantee. Using the generated model, we give two analysis algorithms to estimate the minimum and average values of system behaviors. We show how to apply the learning algorithm even when the alphabet is not fixed. The experimental result is encouraging; the estimation made by our approach is almost as precise as the exact reference answer obtained by a brute-force enumeration.

### main/order_comp

```c++
[timeout, time_each, state, counter_mem, mem,eq_mem] = 
order_comp( order, distri, probability )
```

#### Description
The core function of this learning algorithm is the "order_comp"
This function is used in the learning of the target teacher.

#### Input Description
*order: This argument only valid in the Calculator experiment. It can decide the order of the calculator. When order = 1, the calculator keeps the nature order. On the contrary, if order = 1, the order of alphabet is scattered.

*distri: This argument decides the distribution of the equivalence queries. When distri = 0, the equivalence queries will generate the test membership queries in Monkey distribution. When distri = 1, it will be the uniform distribution. When distri = 2, it will be the fixed length distribution.

*probability: This argument is to decide the stop probability of different distributions. When distri = 0, this argument means the stop probability of Monkey distribution. When distri = 1 and 2, this argument means the equivalence queries' maximum length and fixed length.

#### Output Description

*timeout: This output whether the algorithm stops because of the timeout.

*time_each: This output the total time of the learning algorithm for one time.

*state: This output the iteration number.

*counter_mem: This output the number of membership queries when finding counter examples.

*mem: This output the number of membership queries besides from counter_mem.

*eq_mem: This output the number of membership queries while checking the equivalence queries.

#### Changing the experiments

There is an argument in "order_comp" called fun, which is in line 52 of the function. The different value of fun means different experiment.
*fun = 0: The oracle is a randomly generate matrix. 

*fun = 1: The oracle is the web experiment. 

*fun = 2: The oracle is the Calculator experiment. 

*fun = 3: The oracle is the Missionary & Cannibals experiment. 

*fun = 5: The oracle is the OS Scheduling experiment. 

#### Setting time out.

In line 13, there is an argument called "time_out_range", which can decide the time out value in seconds. The default value of this is set to 900 seconds.

### main/test

```c++
[average,max_value] = test(cat_num,order)
```

#### Description
This function is used to analyze the learned model of MA which can predict the average value and max value of the certain length.

#### Input Description
*cat_num: This input can decide the length that you want to predict.

#### Output Description

*average: This output the average value of the certain length.

*max_value: This output the maximum value of the certain length.
